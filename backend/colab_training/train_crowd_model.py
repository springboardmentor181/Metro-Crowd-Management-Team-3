    # Bug fix (Passenger Analytics widget showing ~0 for every city except
    # Delhi/Kolkata): `passenger_count` spans wildly different scales across
    # cities (Delhi averages ~5700/hour, Pune/Bhopal average ~20-40/hour -
    # see docs/passenger-analytics-model-selection.md). Selecting the "best" model by raw MAE lets
    # a model that's good at Delhi's huge numbers win the comparison purely
    # by dominating the absolute-error sum, even if it's systematically
    # wrong (including negative, clamped to 0) for every smaller city -
    # those cities' errors are individually tiny in absolute terms, so they
    # barely move the MAE needle regardless of how wrong they are
    # proportionally. That's exactly the failure mode that made
    # `all_stations_traffic_pattern()` sum to ~0 for every city except the
    # one or two with the largest ridership.
    #
    # MAPE (mean absolute PERCENTAGE error) instead weighs every station
    # roughly equally in relative terms, so a model has to actually predict
    # each city's own scale reasonably well to win - not just nail
    # whichever city happens to have the biggest numbers.
