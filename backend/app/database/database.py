    raised by the DBAPI (psycopg2) during a connection or cursor
    operation - a dropped/refused connection, an auth failure, a
    statement-timeout cancellation, a constraint violation, etc. This
    is the single place that covers all of them, without threading a
    metrics call through every individual `except Exception` in the
    codebase that happens to be catching a DB error.

    Deliberately does NOT cover a connection-pool checkout timeout
    (sqlalchemy.exc.TimeoutError, DB_POOL_TIMEOUT exceeded): that's
    SQLAlchemy's own pool giving up before it ever attempts a DBAPI
    connection, so this event never fires for it - see
    app/main.py's db_pool_exhausted_handler, which records that case
    separately under reason="pool_exhausted".

    Only the exception's CLASS NAME is used as the metric label -
    never str()/repr() of the exception itself, which for a connection
    failure can contain the DSN (host, port, database name, sometimes
    the username). Returning None (the implicit result of not
    returning context.chained_exception) leaves SQLAlchemy's own error
    handling/propagation completely untouched - this listener only
    observes, it never suppresses or replaces the original error.
