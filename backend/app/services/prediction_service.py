    This exists because the "Passenger Analytics" dashboard widget
    needs an all-stations total, and was previously built by having
    the FRONTEND call GET /traffic-pattern/{station_id} once per
    station via Promise.all() - one HTTP request, one DB round trip,
    and 24 model lookups PER STATION, all fired in parallel on every
    page load. Two compounding problems with that:

    1. This endpoint is rate-limited at 20/minute per IP (see the
       module docstring in api/v1/prediction.py - deliberate, since
       every call here can run an ML model). A city with more than
       ~20 stations blew straight through that limit on a single page
       load, so most of those per-station requests came back 429 and
       the widget surfaced "Couldn't load the forecast right now" -
       not because the prediction service was actually slow or down,
       but because the page itself DDoS'd its own rate limiter.
    2. Even the requests that didn't get rate-limited meant dozens of
       concurrent DB session / ML calls competing for the same
       process, which is what made the ones that DID succeed take
       far longer than a single request should.

    Computing the sum server-side keeps the exact same per-station,
    per-hour Redis-cached prediction calls (so the actual compute cost
    doesn't change and every value stays independently verifiable),
    but collapses N HTTP requests and N rate-limit hits into 1.

# Phase 1 (P0-1 / P2-3) fix. Two independent problems used to compound

#

#      station - up to MAX_STATIONS_ANALYZED=15 of them, in parallel,
#      on every dashboard load AND on every single live `crowd_update`/
#      `delay_alert`/`station_alert` WebSocket event (roughly once per
#      SIMULATOR_INTERVAL_SECONDS). See smart_recommendations_bulk()
#      below and AIInsights.tsx for the frontend half of this fix.
#   2. Independent of #1: every single call to this function - even a
#      pure cache HIT that recomputed nothing - unconditionally wrote 3
#      new `Prediction` rows and committed. That meant DB writes scaled
#      with *dashboard views*, not with *actual new predictions
#      computed*, so the row count grew unbounded purely from people
#      looking at the AI Insights panel.
#
# RECOMMENDATION_WRITE_DEDUPE_SECONDS decouples "record recent AI
# activity for the Activity Timeline widget" from "write on every
# request": a station's 3 predictions are persisted at most once per
# window, no matter how many times smart_recommendations()/
# smart_recommendations_bulk() is called for it in between - by a
# single dashboard tab refreshing, several tabs open at once, or the
# bulk endpoint being hit repeatedly. This is a separate Redis key from
# PREDICTION_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS (the *value* cache) - a value-cache hit

    here to the AI Insights panel (Phase 1, P0-1).

    Previously, AIInsights.tsx ranked up to MAX_STATIONS_ANALYZED=15
    stations by occupancy and fired 15 parallel
    `GET /predictions/recommendations/{station_id}` calls via
    Promise.all() - on every dashboard load AND on every single live
    crowd/delay/station-alert WebSocket event (roughly every
    SIMULATOR_INTERVAL_SECONDS=10s). That's up to 90 rate-limited calls
    per minute from a single browser tab against an endpoint capped at
    20/minute per IP, so most of them came back 429, and (independent
    of the 429s) every *successful* call still wrote 3 Prediction rows
    per the pre-fix version of _save_prediction usage above.

    Collapsing this to one endpoint means: 1 rate-limit slot consumed
    per refresh instead of up to 15, and the per-station cached
    crowd/delay/frequency lookups (_cached_predict_crowd etc.) are
    still reused across stations exactly as before - no compute or
    caching behaviour changes per station, only the transport (1 HTTP
    round trip instead of N) and the write path (see
    _maybe_persist_recommendation_predictions above) change.
