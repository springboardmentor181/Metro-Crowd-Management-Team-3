    `since`, computed ENTIRELY in SQL via window functions + GROUP BY,
    instead of pulling every raw CrowdLog row in the window into
    Python and walking it with a running-previous-count loop.

    RAM FIX (Render Free 512MB): the previous approach - `SELECT
    station_id, current_count [, created_at] ... WHERE created_at >=
    :since` then `.all()` - was already scoped by station_ids and a
    clamped time window (see MAX_HISTORY_WINDOW_HOURS above), but nothing
    bounded the *row count* returned within that window. At the
    simulator's CROWD_HISTORY_INTERVAL_SECONDS sampling rate, a
    legitimate-looking request for the maximum allowed window (30 days)
    across every active station can still mean materializing millions
    of CrowdLog rows as Python tuples in one request - exactly the
    "large query loads excessive history into Python RAM" failure mode
    this fix targets, just reached through an oversized `hours` value
    rather than a missing LIMIT.

    This query returns at most one aggregated row PER STATION (a small,
    fixed-size result - one row per station in `station_ids`) no matter
    how many raw samples exist in the window or how wide the window is;
    Postgres does the per-row delta/ordering work and only ships back
    the already-summed totals. The computed inflow/outflow/samples
    values are exactly the same numbers the old Python loop produced:
    that loop routed a delta of exactly 0 into its `else` (outflow)
    branch, contributing `abs(0) == 0` either way, which is the same
    as this query's `delta > 0` / `delta < 0` split (0 falls into
    neither `CASE`, contributing 0 to both) - only *how* the totals
    are computed changed, not *what* they mean.

    `last_count` is the most recent sample's current_count within the
    window (ROW_NUMBER() over each station ordered by created_at DESC,
    keeping rn = 1) - used by analytics_service.passenger_flow_overview
    for its occupancy KPI, which previously had to keep the last row it
