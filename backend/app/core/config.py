    # numpy/pandas/scipy/scikit-learn/xgboost - can push the process
    # over the memory limit before it even starts accepting traffic.
    # Defaulting this to False makes each predictor load lazily on its
    # own first use instead (still cached after that via lru_cache),

    # a single worker process will hold open at once; beyond it, new
    # connections are rejected cleanly (WS close code 1013, "try again
    # later") before the handshake is even accepted, so a rejected
    # client never occupies a connection slot and every already-
    # connected client is unaffected. 200 is generously above normal

    # outsized share of WS_MAX_CONNECTIONS on its own. Anonymous
